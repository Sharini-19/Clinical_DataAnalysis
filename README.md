Project Overview

Objective
The primary objective of this project is to predict whether a diabetic patient will be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge. This analysis is crucial as it can help healthcare providers identify at-risk patients and implement preventive measures to enhance patient outcomes and effectively manage hospital resources.

Dataset
The dataset utilized in this project can be accessed on Kaggle. It contains data from over 100,000 hospital admissions of diabetic patients from various US hospitals covering the period from 1999 to 2008. The data includes several features related to patient demographics, admission details, medical test results, and previous admission information.

Tools and Technologies
The following tools and technologies are used in this project to handle data processing, modeling, and visualization:
- Python: The main programming language used for the project due to its flexibility and powerful libraries.
- Pandas: Utilized for efficient data manipulation and analysis.
- Scikit-learn: Employed for building predictive models. It offers various modeling techniques and metrics for evaluating model performance.
- Matplotlib: Used for data visualization to create insightful charts and graphs for exploratory data analysis.

Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing: Includes cleaning data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Involves analyzing the distribution of key variables and uncovering patterns and correlations that could affect readmission rates.
3. Feature Engineering: Enhancing the model's performance by creating new features that capture relevant information not depicted by the raw data alone.
4. Model Building: Utilizing logistic regression as a baseline model and exploring more complex models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting to improve prediction accuracy.
5. Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves.
6. Iteration: Refining models based on performance metrics and feedback loops to improve the prediction outcomes.
